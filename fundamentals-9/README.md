# Fundamentals 9
* Object Orientation
## Inheritance
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Polimorfism
## Being S.O.L.I.D
* S: Class should only have one responsibility and one reason
to change. Less tests and fewer dependecies.
* O: Open to extension, closed to modification. Classes we create should only be open to be extended.
* L: Liskov Substitiusion. If class B is a subclass of type A Then we should be able to replace A with B without breaking the code.
* I: Interface segregation. Larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones. By doing so we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are interest to them.
* D: Dependency inversion. Refers to the decoupling
## Maps
Map is a interface.
